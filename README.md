## 🎯 Introduction
We have proposed complete solution which involves
Interactive chatbot: Enables data and rule uploads, fetches real-time internet data, and assists with regulatory compliance queries.
LLM (Large Language Model): Extracts and interprets regulatory reporting rules, also pre-processes data based on mentioned rules and input values
Hybrid ML: Analyses data, adaptively assigns a risk score and risk severity based on rules, current market trends, and weightages of different attributes that contribute towards risk.
ML and LLM also suggest remediation techniques based on type of risk imposed or type of rule failed![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545bf702-fe99-4f11-9353-ac4dcccf355d)

## 💡 Inspiration
Working for the Regulatory & Data Engineering workspace withing Wellsfarho, especially the interest in Next Gen AI & Generative AI technologies.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Using FARM Tech Stach with Open AI's Chat GPT 4o mini LLM & Hybrid ML for Risk Scoring & Analysis of data.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Most free-tier AI and data modeling platforms impose strict limitations on the amount of data they can handle at once, particularly in terms of token limits for large language models (LLMs) and memory constraints for machine learning frameworks. 
Within this, we had to strategically optimize our approach by refining prompts to minimize token usage, and leveraging efficient pre-processing techniques to maximize the utility of available resources.
Due to the extensive nature of the Federal Reserve's regulatory reporting guidelines and time constraints, we focused our solution on the Retail sector. However, our approach is designed to be scalable and adaptable to other reporting schedules as well.
